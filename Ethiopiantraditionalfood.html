    <h3>Ethiopian most popular food</h3>
    
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down</p>
    
    <h4>Bayenetu (mixed vegitable)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Injera</li>
        <li>cabbage</li>
        <li>Atir kik wot</li>
        <li>carrot</li>
        <li>potatoes</li>
        <li>Tikil gomen</li>
        <li>Misir wat</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Injera Combine the teff flour and 12 cups water. Mix, cover and store in a dark, cool place for 3 to 4 days to ferment, giving it its sour flavor</li>
        <li>Heat a large cast-iron pan over medium heat. Pour 1 cup fermented mixture into it, swirling the pan to cover the entire surface area</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid, 2 to 3 minutes. Injera is ready to plate when holes have formed on the surface. Place the injera on a plate and serve.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cook the carrots and onion in the hot oil about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the salt, pepper, cumin, turmeric, and cabbage and cook another 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes; cover.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until potatoes are soft, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
